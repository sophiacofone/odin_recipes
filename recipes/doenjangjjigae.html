    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">I came across this recipe when I was looking for more uses for the Doenjang and Gochujang I had bought
        for my mapo tofu. I learned that many Koreans eat Doenjang Jjigae as a comfort food! 
        I tried it out, and have since ate it SO many times. It has a wonderful flavor and smell, and is a great way
        to eat tons of veggies!

      <p class="description">The majority of this recipe comes from <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/doenjang-jjigae">Maangchi</a>.
        I have customized it in order to use ingredients that I have on hand. Serves 2-4.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 small zucchini, cut into ½-inch pieces (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>1 medium potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>½ cup shiitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 piece kombu</li>
      <li>1 cup katsuobushi</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp Doenjang</li>
      <li>½ tsp Gochujang</li>
      <li>6 ounces medium-firm tofu, cut into ½-inch cubes (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the water and kombu to a medium saucepan (or earthenware pot). If you have time, soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes. Do not remove white stuff on kombu.</li>
      <li>SLOWLY bring it to a boil on medium-low heat so you can extract as much umami from the kombu as possible (about 10 minutes). Right before the stock boils, remove the kombu and set it aside.</li>
      <li>Add the katsuobushi to the kombu dashi and let it simmer for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
      <li>Add the dashi to the saucepan and bring back to simmer.</li>
      <li>Add potato, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook for 15 minutes until potatos are done.</li>
      <li>Stir in the soybean paste, mixing well.</li>
      <li>Add the tofu and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with the green onions and serve as a side dish to rice.</li>
    </ol>
