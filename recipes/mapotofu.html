    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious and spicy Chinese recipe from the Sichuan Province. I had this 
        dish for the first time while studying abroad in Hong Kong. I absolutly fell in love with it.
        The silken tofu is the probably my favorite part; it just has the perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture! 
        Another important aspect is the "spicy bean sauce" (the Korean version is "Gochujang"). The fermented bean paste
        gives mapo tofu Unami and a complex flavor that in my opinion makes it taste way more similar to 
        what I had in HK.

      <p>The majority of this recipe comes from <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/mapo-tofu/">Just One Cookbook</a>.
        I have simplified it in order to use ingredients that I have on hand (as well as tone-down the spice level a bit, I know embarrassing). Serves 6.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 knob ginger</li>
      <li>1 cup katsuobushi</li>
      <li>2 green onions/scallions</li>
      <li>14 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the Seasonings</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ Tbsp Doenjang</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Gochujang</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp miso</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
      <li>½ Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp potato starch or cornstarch/li>
      <li>4 Tbsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine all the ingredients for the seasonings in a bowl and mix well together.</li>
      <li>Mince the garlic cloves and ginger finely.</li>
      <li>Cut the green onions into small pieces. Drain the tofu and cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.</li>
      <li>In a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil on medium heat and sauté the garlic and ginger. Make sure you don't burn them. Once they are fragrant, add the ground pork and break it up with a spatula.</li>
      <li>When the meat is no longer pink, add the seasonings mixture and stir thoroughly. Bring the sauce to a boil.</li>
      <li>Once the sauce is boiling, add the tofu and gently coat it with the sauce. Stir frequently, without mashing the tofu, until it is heated through. Add the green onions and stir to incorporate just before taking the pan off the heat. Serve immediately.</li>
