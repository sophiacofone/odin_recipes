    <h1 class="title">Miso Soup</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This is a simple and traditional recipe for miso soup. It is a light side-dish, 
      but it can also be somewhat substantial with additions like mushrooms and 
      tofu. The fun thing about miso soup is that you can add so many different 
      veggies to it. To me, a good miso soup is all about the broth and high-quality 
      miso paste.

      <p class="description">The majority of this recipe comes from <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/">Just One Cookbook</a>.
        I have customized it recipe with my favorite ingredients. Serves 4 as a side-dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 piece kombu</li>
      <li>1 cup katsuobushi</li>
      <li>7 oz soft/silken tofu</li>
      <li>2-3 Tbsp miso</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed</li>
      <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
      <li>1 cup shiitake mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the water and kombu to a medium saucepan. If you have time, soak the kombu in water for 30 minutes. Do not remove white stuff on kombu.</li>
      <li>SLOWLY bring it to a boil on medium-low heat so you can extract as much umami from the kombu as possible (about 10 minutes). Right before the stock boils, remove the kombu and set it aside.</li>
      <li>Add the katsuobushi to the kombu dashi and let it simmer for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
      <li>Add the dashi to the saucepan and bring back to simmer.</li>
      <li>Add mushrooms and let simmer for 3-4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the miso. Put the miso in a ladle, slowly add the dashi into the ladle, and stir with chopsticks to dissolve the miso completely. Do not let the soup boil once the miso goes in, as this will kill the good probiotics in the fermented miso.</li>
      <li>Cut the tofu into Â½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes and add to the miso soup.</li>
      <li>Add the dried wakame seaweed and chopped green onions just before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve!</li>
    </ol>
