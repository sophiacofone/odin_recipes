# odin_recipes
## From the Odin Project

This repository contains a basic HTML website designed to be a Recipe Book of 3 of my all-time favorite recipes. This project helped to reinforce basic HTML skills such as:
1. Creating an HTML "boilerplate"
2. Creating absolute and relative links
3. Adding images
4. Using paragraph and list tags

This project also helped me gain some additional familiarity with Git and Github.
